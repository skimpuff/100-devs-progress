# #100Devs: Week One & Two :coffee:

**testing** *markdown document*!
### Happy 2022!

This Document will track my progress through the beginning weeks of **#100DEVS**! I'm "taking notes" despite having learned that summarizing and note-taking are not the most effective learning methods. The main reasons being (1) to improve upon my communcation skills and (2) to work on my markdown documentaiton skills. Hopefully, this will transfer over to when I build bigger projects -- I'll have gotten into the habit of having a clear layout via planning and documentation, which will streamline the development process, and be helpful in a collaborative setting, where others can understand my thought process. 
 

## Tasks aka Doing The Work
1. Learn How To Learn (practise ACTIVE RECALL METHOD)
   1. take Qs instead of verbatim notes (jeopardy! style)
   2. spaced repetition > re-reading & note-taking (ironic, given how comforting this is)
   3. what is chunking? do little spurts rather than cramming all at once.
2. Construct semantic HTML page given the BBC site reference image, above the fold
3. Know What You Don't Know!

## Key Takeaways :key:
- practise writing *SEMANTIC* HTML
  - use MDN for documentation, NOT W3School whatever!
  - live updates! :fish:
- focus on ACTIVELY RECALLING information
  - leads to implementation, not sheer memorization



### DIG DEEP not WIDE!
- this is the fatal flaw of those just eginning their coding journey!


### Writing is Hard!
Concise, effective communication takes time and effort. 
  

### Welcome World!
